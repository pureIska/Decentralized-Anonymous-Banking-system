part 1-How does it works?

character:A: person trying to invest in the bank by giving it 100 bitcoin
B: ask the bank 100 bitcoin for a project
C and D: get paid by B to do some work.
Bank: the bank, duh!
fakecoin: fake bitcoin that are linked to the bank so they can be taken back by it.

Person A want to invest in the bank, he place 100 bitcoin in the Bank while expecting to get it back with 5 more bitcoin.
Person B want some money for a project, ask the Bank for 100 bitcoin and give them 5 bitcoin (just in case)
The Bank DO NOT GIVE THE BITCOIN, but instead give a certain amount of coin that represent 100 bitcoin. lets call this the FakeCoin.
The fakecoin doesnt have value since the Bank will own every single one of them and they will be linked to the bank.

part 2-If the person B is trustworthy:
He can pay anyone with the fakecoin to make any work. If B is able to make money, a part of it will directly go into A's wallet. As soon as he refound the 105 bictoin (100+5 he gave at the start) the transaction almost over. The last part of it is: The Bank will take every single part of fakecoin that anyone received from B and pay them back in bitcoin for their work.

person A send 100 bitcoin to bank
bank send 100 fakecoin to B and B send 5 bitcoin to bank
bank send 5 to A
B pay other worker (C and D) each 50 fakecoin
B receive 1000 bitcoin from work and send 100 to bank
bank now have 200
bank TAKE(not receive, take) C's 50 fakecoin and give him 50 bitcoin
bank do the same thing for D since he also have fakecoin
bank now have 100 bitcoin left, B have his own bitcoin(like C and D) and A have 5
bank now give his 100 bitcoin left to A that in the end have 105 bitcoin like he asked.

part 3-If B isn't trustworthy
A give 100 bitcoin to bank
B give 5 bitcoin to bank
bank give 5 bitcoin to A and 100 fakecoin to B
B make an evil thing (yes, i said evil)
bank take 100 fakecoin back since they are linked to him
bank give 100 bitcoin back to A

in the end: A gained 5 bitcoin
and B did something not allowed and lost 5 bitcoin

part 4-Is there a time limit for B to refound A?
Depend of A's decision, example: B pay 5 to bank and bank send 5 to A
If for a long ammount of time, B doesnt send anything to A.
A can ask his 100 bitcoin back, and will give B his 5 exept if bank noticed that he did somthing wrong.
but if the bank decide that A is just trying to get a total of 105 bitcoin without waiting and ruinning B.
A must give back the 5 bitcoin+ 5 other bitcoin (or any amount decided by the bank) to B to make sure that A will be patient and wont try to make money while did nothing wrong B.
This was made to be sure that A isn't making profit from part 3.

part 5-What If B only refound a part of the bitcoin in a big ammount of time and A want his money back?
A will not receive his 100 bitcoin back in total since B still gave him some money.
if B refound only 40 bitcoin in a certain ammount of time and A want it back he will only receive 60 bitcoin and the rest of the 100 bitcoin in the bank (also 40) will go to B + the 2.5(or any other amount)/5 bitcoin that B gave at start.
B Receive some of the 5 bitcoin back since he still was trust worthy (he gave 40 back out of 100), but his work wasn't enaugh since he gave it in a really long ammount of time. More time for refounding=lower part of the 5$ back.
(better and faster you work = less risk of A asking money back) (worst and slower work= more risk of A getting money back and receive a litle lower part of the 5 bitcoin)

part 6-Risk of C or D being the bad guy
If B ask money to the bank, it is because he trust C and D to do the work like he asked.
C and D must also trust B since they are accepting fakecoin and not bitcoin from him.
if B is taking too many risk, example: D isn't trustworthy but he still give him 50 fakecoin, it was his fault to do it and the bank will conside that B did the bad thing and get all fakecoin back while giving A his bitcoin back (like in part 2)

part 7- If an accident happen and B can't refound.
A can choose to get his money back or to wait until B has the money. If he will not be able to get it back, for now it will be considered like part 5 or 4. (tell me if you have a solution for this tho)
